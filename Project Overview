#In the fall semester, I worked closely with a group of my peers to build a database containing the information from a Kaggle dataset. To complete the project we first had to clean the data, then create tables using SQL, and next devise questions that could be solved using SQL queries. Finally, we created an application that summarizes all of our work. I contributed by writing create table commands, creating one out of the 5 SQL queries, and building the main pages of the application. In this repository, I highlight all of that work of mine.
